# Registration Form

This project is a simple registration form developed using DHTML (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The form takes user inputs for fields like name, email, password, and confirm password. It performs validation on these inputs and, upon successful validation, redirects the user to the login page.

## Features

- **Input Fields**: The form includes fields for:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Password
  - Confirm Password

- **Validation**: The form validates the following:
  - Name: Ensures the name field is not empty.
  - Email: Checks if the email is in a valid format.
  - Password: Verifies the password meets the specified criteria (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
  - Confirm Password: Ensures the confirm password field matches the password.

- **Redirection**: If all fields are filled out correctly, the user is redirected to the login page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the form.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the form to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side validation of the form inputs.
